# Solve a Rubik's Cube using Python, OpenCV, and Kociemba Module

✨This repository contains the code and resources to solve a Rubik's Cube using Python, OpenCV, and the Kociemba module. The Kociemba module provides an efficient implementation of Kociemba's Two-Phase Algorithm, which is widely used for solving Rubik's Cubes.

## Prerequisites

🎁Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Python 3.x: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- OpenCV: `pip install opencv-python`
- Kociemba module: `pip install kociemba`

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rubiks-cube-solver.git
2. Change into the project directory:
    ```bash
   cd rubiks-cube-solver 
3. Run the solve_cube.py script:
   ```bash
   python solve_cube.py
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the colors of the Rubik's Cube faces. Use the following color codes:
    ```bash
    W: White
    Y: Yellow
    G: Green
    B: Blue
    R: Red
    O: Orange
5. Once you have entered the colors for all the faces, the program will analyze the cube and provide a solution in the form of move notations.
